## Exercise 2: Exploration

### Step 0: Explanation of Module Generation
A10's Ansible modules are generated off of ACOS schema files. These schema files are also used to create the API

### Step 1: Explore the AXAPI
Navigate to https://documentation.a10networks.com/index.html. You'll need to sign in with your A10 networks support account.

Once you've signed in, scroll down the page and find list item with the text `View ACOS 4.1.4-GR1-P1 documentation.` Click on that link, and scroll down until you reach the `Documentation Matrix`.

Under the `Reference Documentation for User Interfaces Used to Configure the Device` table view the HTML version of the `aXAPIv3 Reference Guide`. This guide contains links to our API endpoints.
